# Processing text

1. File processing - **RUN ONCE**
    - Read pdf for more information

2. Exact count - **RUN ONCE**
    - Count the number of words in the text using an exhaustive method

3. Probabilistic count - **RUN A FEW TIMES**
    - Most frequent words
    - Least frequent words

4. Data Stream Algorithm - **RUN ONCE**
    - Most frequent words

5. Do a memory footprint of all algorithms, how much memory do we use for every algorithm?

## Extra
Cardinality, number of distinct items (topic of last class)
Use bloom filters to estimate the number of distinct items

## Tips
Create tables to show word counts, it's better than graphics
