voltaire england previous publication
henriade published english essay epic poetry
european nations highly praised severely attacked
lusiad french editions essay made various
alterations different times article camoëns
however improper premise amazing falsities
detected gross misrepresentation every objection refuted
demonstration brought voltaire wrote english essay

unpoetical version fanshaw

trissino says voltaire clearing away rubbish
italy barbarity ignorance heaped ten centuries

course acquired reputation lasts still among countrymen
pay much respect memory english milton

fate audacious undertaking portuguese
foretells misfortunes must undergo indies
believe fiction would thought noble proper

portuguese nation besides enchanted
island called island bliss fleet finds way
home rising sea comfort reward
camoëns describes place tasso years depicted
island armida supernatural power brings beauties
presents pleasures nature afford heart
may wish goddess enamoured vasco gama carries
top high mountain whence shows kingdoms
earth foretells fate portugal

camoëns hath given loose fancy description
pleasures gama crew enjoyed island takes care
inform reader ought understand fiction nothing
satisfaction virtuous man feels glory
accrues practice virtue best excuse
invention charming style delivered may
believe portuguese beauty elocution sometimes makes
amends faults poet colouring rubens makes
defects figures pass unregarded

_another_ kind machinery continued throughout poem
nothing excuse injudicious mixture heathen
gods religion gama storm addresses prayers christ
venus comes relief heroes christians
poet heathen main design portuguese supposed
next promoting trade propagate christianity yet
jupiter bacchus venus hands management
voyage incongruous machinery casts blemish upon whole
poem yet shows time prevailing beauties
since portuguese like faults

lusiad says voltaire contains sort epic poetry unheard
heroes wounded thousand different ways woman

handsome copy iliad jerusalem delivered
imitations however successful many epics
ancient modern times hurried stream oblivion

virgil tasso could add little novelty wonder
therefore many epics battles sieges suffered
sink utter neglect camoëns perhaps weigh
circumstances strength poetical genius directed
could feel read virgil homer
original turn force mind led beaten track
