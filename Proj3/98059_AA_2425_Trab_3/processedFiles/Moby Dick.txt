returning spouterinn chapel found queequeg
quite alone left chapel benediction
time sitting bench fire feet

little negro idol peering hard face
jackknife gently whittling away nose meanwhile humming
heathenish way

interrupted put image pretty soon going
table took large book placing lap
began counting pages deliberate regularity every fiftieth

one time though could count fifty
large number fifties found together
astonishment multitude pages excited

much interest sat watching savage though
hideously marred faceat least tastehis countenance
yet something means disagreeable
cannot hide soul unearthly tattooings thought
saw traces simple honest heart large deep eyes
fiery black bold seemed tokens spirit would dare
thousand devils besides certain lofty

whilst thus closely scanning halfpretending meanwhile
looking storm casement never heeded
presence never troubled much single glance
appeared wholly occupied counting pages marvellous
book considering sociably sleeping together night
previous especially considering affectionate arm found
thrown upon waking morning thought indifference
strange savages strange beings times
know exactly take first overawing
calm selfcollectedness simplicity seems socratic wisdom
noticed also queequeg never consorted little

whether bedfellows told yes whereat
thought looked pleased perhaps little complimented

turned book together endeavored explain
purpose printing meaning pictures
thus soon engaged interest
went jabbering best could various outer sights

producing pouch tomahawk quietly offered puff
sat exchanging puffs wild pipe keeping

seemed sign common bodily illness
recovery looked like man cut away stake
fire overrunningly wasted limbs without consuming
taking away one particle compacted aged robustness

unalterable mould like cellinis cast perseus threading way

fortitude determinate unsurrenderable wilfulness fixed

gestures expressions plainly showed uneasy
painful consciousness troubled mastereye
moody stricken ahab stood crucifixion

chapter 45 affidavit

far may narrative book indeed
indirectly touching one two interesting curious
particulars habits sperm whales foregoing chapter
earlier part important one found
volume leading matter requires still
familiarly enlarged upon order adequately understood
moreover take away incredulity profound ignorance
entire subject may induce minds natural verity
main points affair

care perform part task methodically shall
content produce desired impression separate citations
items practically reliably known whaleman
citations take itthe conclusion aimed naturally
follow

first personally known three instances whale
receiving harpoon effected complete escape
interval one instance three years struck
hand slain two irons marked
private cypher taken body instance
three years intervened flinging two harpoons
think may something man darted
happening interval go trading ship voyage
africa went ashore joined discovery party penetrated far
interior travelled period nearly two years
often endangered serpents savages tigers poisonous miasmas
common perils incident wandering heart
unknown regions meanwhile whale struck must also
travels doubt thrice circumnavigated globe
brushing flanks coasts africa purpose
man whale came together one vanquished
say known three instances similar
two saw whales struck upon second
attack saw two irons respective marks cut
afterwards taken dead fish threeyear instance
fell boat times first last
last time distinctly recognised peculiar sort huge mole
whales eye observed three years previous say
three years pretty sure three
instances personally know truth heard
many instances persons whose veracity matter
good ground impeach

secondly well known sperm whale fishery however ignorant
world ashore may several memorable
historical instances particular whale ocean
distant times places popularly cognisable whale became
thus marked altogether originally owing bodily
peculiarities distinguished whales however peculiar
respect chance whale may soon put end
peculiarities killing boiling peculiarly
valuable oil reason fatal experiences
fishery hung terrible prestige perilousness

fishermen content recognise merely touching
tarpaulins would discovered lounging
without seeking cultivate intimate acquaintance like
poor devils ashore happen know irascible great man

presumption

know find better place make
mention one two things seem important
printed form establishing respects reasonableness
whole story white whale especially catastrophe
one disheartening instances truth requires full
much bolstering error ignorant landsmen
plainest palpable wonders world without
hints touching plain facts historical otherwise
fishery might scout moby dick monstrous fable still
worse detestable hideous intolerable allegory

first though men vague flitting ideas general
perils grand fishery yet nothing like fixed vivid
conception perils frequency recur
one reason perhaps one fifty actual disasters
deaths casualties fishery ever finds public record
home however transient immediately forgotten record
suppose poor fellow moment perhaps caught
whaleline coast new guinea carried
bottom sounding leviathando suppose
poor fellows name appear newspaper obituary
read tomorrow breakfast mails
irregular new guinea fact ever hear
might called regular news direct indirect new guinea yet
tell upon one particular voyage made pacific
among many others spoke thirty different ships every one
death whale one three
lost boats crew gods sake economical
lamps candles gallon burn least one drop
mans blood spilled

secondly people ashore indeed indefinite idea whale
enormous creature enormous power ever found
narrating specific example twofold
enormousness significantly complimented upon
facetiousness declare upon soul idea
facetious moses wrote history plagues
egypt

fortunately special point seek established upon
testimony entirely independent point sperm
whale cases sufficiently powerful knowing judiciously
malicious direct aforethought stave utterly destroy
sink large ship sperm whale _has_ done

first year 1820 ship essex captain pollard nantucket
cruising pacific ocean one day saw spouts lowered
boats gave chase shoal sperm whales ere long several
whales wounded suddenly large whale escaping
boats issued shoal bore directly upon
ship dashing forehead hull stove
less ten minutes settled fell
surviving plank seen since severest
exposure part crew reached land boats
returned home last captain pollard sailed pacific
command another ship gods shipwrecked upon
unknown rocks breakers second time ship utterly
lost forthwith forswearing never tempted since
day captain pollard resident nantucket seen
owen chace chief mate essex time tragedy
read plain faithful narrative conversed
within miles scene catastrophe

following extracts chaces narrative every fact seemed
warrant concluding anything chance
directed operations made two several attacks upon ship
short interval according
direction calculated us injury made
ahead thereby combining speed two objects
shock effect exact manœuvres made
necessary aspect horrible indicated
resentment fury came directly shoal
entered struck three companions
fired revenge sufferings events
whole circumstances taken together happening eyes
producing time impressions mind decided
calculating mischief part whale many
impressions cannot recall induce satisfied
correct opinion

reflections time quitting ship
black night open boat almost despairing reaching
hospitable shore dark ocean swelling waters nothing
fears swallowed dreadful tempest dashed upon
hidden rocks ordinary subjects fearful
contemplation seemed scarcely entitled moments thought
dismal looking wreck _the horrid aspect revenge whale_
wholly engrossed reflections day made appearance

another placep 45he speaks _the mysterious mortal attack
animal_

secondly ship union also nantucket year 1807
totally lost azores similar onset authentic
particulars catastrophe never chanced encounter
though whale hunters heard casual
allusions

thirdly eighteen twenty years ago commodore j

considering monomania hint vindictiveness towards
white whale might possibly extended degree
sperm whales monsters slew much
multiplied chances subsequently encountered whale would
prove hated one hunted hypothesis
indeed exceptionable still additional considerations
though strictly according wildness ruling
passion yet means incapable swaying

accomplish object ahab must use tools tools used

man mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual
mastership purely spiritual intellectual stand

captains quest could would joyfully disintegrate
even frustrate might long interval would
elapse ere white whale seen long interval starbuck
would ever apt fall open relapses rebellion
captains leadership unless ordinary prudential circumstantial
influences brought bear upon subtle
insanity ahab respecting moby dick noways significantly
manifested superlative sense shrewdness foreseeing
present hunt way stripped
strange imaginative impiousness naturally invested
full terror voyage must kept withdrawn obscure
background mens courage proof protracted
meditation unrelieved action stood long night
watches officers men must nearer things think
moby dick however eagerly impetuously savage crew
hailed announcement quest yet sailors sorts
less capricious unreliablethey live varying outer
weather inhale ficklenessand retained
object remote blank pursuit however promissory life
passion end things requisite temporary
interests employments intervene hold healthily
suspended final dash

ahab unmindful another thing times strong emotion
mankind disdain base considerations times evanescent
permanent constitutional condition manufactured man thought
ahab sordidness granting white whale fully incites
hearts savage crew playing round savageness even
breeds certain generous knighterrantism still
love give chase moby dick must also food

chivalric crusaders old times content traverse two
thousand miles land fight holy sepulchre without

perquisites way strictly held one final
romantic objectthat final romantic object many would
turned disgust strip men thought ahab
hopes cashaye cash may scorn cash let
months go perspective promise
quiescent cash mutinying cash would

wanting still another precautionary motive related
ahab personally impulsively probable perhaps
somewhat prematurely revealed prime private purpose
pequods voyage ahab entirely conscious
indirectly laid open unanswerable charge
usurpation perfect impunity moral legal crew

obedience even violently wrest command
even barely hinted imputation usurpation possible

whales belly temporarily lodged part mouth
seems reasonable enough good bishop truly right
whales mouth would accommodate couple whisttables
comfortably seat players possibly jonah might
ensconced hollow tooth second thoughts right
whale toothless

another reason sagharbor went name urged
want faith matter prophet something obscurely
reference incarcerated body whales gastric juices

figurehead would add possibly called whale
craft nowadays christened shark gull eagle
wanting learned exegetists opined
whale mentioned book jonah merely meant lifepreserveran
inflated bag windwhich endangered prophet swam

chapter 105 whales magnitude diminishwill perish

inasmuch leviathan comes floundering upon us

long course generations degenerated
original bulk sires

upon investigation find whales
present day superior magnitude whose fossil remains
found tertiary system embracing distinct geological period
prior man whales found tertiary system

still another inquiry remains one often agitated
recondite nantucketers whether owing almost omniscient
lookouts mastheads whaleships penetrating even
