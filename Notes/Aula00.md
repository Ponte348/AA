Traveling Salesman Problem and Hamiltonian Cycle/Loops are **Hard Graph Problems**.
Traveling Salesman ir an **Optimization problem**.

# Computational Efficiency
Ways to classify algorithms that have the same output regarding efficiency.

The analysis can be:
- How fast
- How much memory

Should be done on the same hardware, by the same person and tested multiple times. Number of operations carried out is more relevant than time taken.

## Formal Analysis
Closed formula.
Pen and paper.
## Experimental Analysis
Extrapolation or reading graphs.
Running the solution several times and counting operations.
Involves running code.
