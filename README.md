Repository for the Advanced Algorithms course.
Here you can find the three projects I worked on.
1. Applying exhaustive search and greedy algorithms to solve the min cut problem.
2. Using probabilistic algorithms to solve the min cut problem.
3. Developing a word counter using an exhaustive algorithm, a probabilistic algorithm, and a streaming algorithm.
